    <p>A <b>choir</b> (also known as <b>chorale</b> or <b>chorus</b>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_ensemble" title="Musical ensemble">musical ensemble</a> of singers. <b>Choral music</b>, in turn, is the music written specifically for such an ensemble to perform.</p>
    <p>A body of singers who perform together as a group is called a choir or chorus. The former term is very often applied to groups affiliated with a church (whether or not they actually occupy the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choir_(architecture)" title="Choir (architecture)">choir</a>) and the second to groups that perform in theatres or concert halls, but this distinction is far from rigid.</p>
    <p>The term "Choir" has the secondary definition of a subset of an ensemble; thus one speaks of the "woodwind choir" of an orchestra, or different "choirs" of voices and/or instruments in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetian_polychoral_style" title="Venetian polychoral style">polychoral</a> composition. In typical 18th- to 21st-century <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oratorio" title="Oratorio">oratorios</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mass_(music)" title="Mass (music)">masses</a>, chorus or choir is usually understood to imply more than one singer per part, in contrast to the quartet of soloists also featured in these works.</p>
